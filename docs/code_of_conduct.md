# RCOS Community Code of Conduct

In order to foster a welcoming and inclusive community, we ask that you please follow the RCOS Community Code of Conduct at all RCOS and [your project]-affiliated events and meetings as well as on all online media used by RCOS and [your project].

## In-Person Large Group Etiquette
The following sections apply to RCOS's large group meetings on Fridays at 4:00 PM in DCC 318. 

### Laptop/Mobile Device Policy
RCOS likes to maintain a culture of freedom. If you choose to use your laptop or mobile device during large group presentations, you may do so as long as you are mindful of the people around you. This includes:
* muting all audio
* not participating in audio or video calls
* refraining from browsing anything considered NSFW (not safe for work)

In addition, some speakers may ask audience members to close all laptops and put away all mobile devices. If a speaker does so, please respect their request.

If you absolutely must take a phone call, you can exit the lecture hall to make/take a phone call. If you need to call emergency services for any reason, you may remain in the room while you make the call.

If you use assistive technology due to a documented disability or injury, **please touch base with a coordinator or faculty member ASAP**. This will remain confidential.

### Noise Policy
An important part of RCOS is being able to hear from both fellow RCOS members and guest speakers. During presentations, we ask that you refrain from talking or making excessive noise as it can be disruptive to the speaker and to your peers.

## General Code of Conduct
The following sections apply to all RCOS and [your project]-affiliated activity online and offline.

### Harassment Policy
In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, RCOS pledges to be a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, educational background, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

Harassment, both online and offline, towards current or former RCOS students, mentors, coordinators, faculty, guest speakers, or external project contributors will not be tolerated. Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered unethical or unprofessional

The Harassment Policy is adapted from the Contributor Covenant, version 1.4,
available at https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/1/4/code-of-conduct.html

### Reporting Violations
At any point, you may report a Code of Conduct violation to any of your mentors or a coordinator. If you do not have access to RCOS's Slack channel and/or you are not affiliated with RPI, you may contact the RCOS coordinators at [email]. You, as well as any other witnesses, have the right to remain anonymous to the rest of the RCOS community.

### Consequences
If you violate the RCOS Community Code of Conduct, appropriate consequences will follow at the discretion of faculty. These may include:

* A verbal or Slack warning from a mentor or coordinator
* A written warning from a faculty member
* A request to edit or delete any blog posts, code, comments, issues, pull requests, milestones, wiki pages, social media posts, etc. that violate the Code of Conduct
* If the violation occurred at an RCOS event or meeting, you may be removed from the event or meeting. This will be marked as an unexcused absence regardless of whether or not you already entered an attendance code, and you will not be able to make up this absence by attending a bonus session.
* In severe and repeated instances of harassment, you may be removed from RCOS entirely. If you are taking RCOS for credit, you will receive a failing grade for the semester.

#### If you are not affiliated with RPI and/or RCOS:

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the projectâ€™s leadership.
