# RCOS Mentor Code of Conduct

Thank you for giving back to the RCOS community by becoming a mentor! This Code of Conduct outlines behavioral standards to foster a welcoming community. This is a supplement to the Community Code of Conduct, which can be found [here].

## Giving Feedback
Please be respectful and constructive when giving feedback to your mentees, especially new or less experienced members. Unacceptable behavior is outlined in the Harassment Policy of the Community Code of Conduct.

## Handling Incident Reports
If someone reports an incident to you, please adhere to the following guidelines:
* Be supportive. This is probably a difficult time for the person reporting the incident, and they are trusting you to help them through this. If you are talking to the person face-to-face, give them a private place to discuss the incident and allow them to bring a friend or trusted individual if they would like.
* Assume good intentions, and trust that the person is being truthful. 
* Gather as much information as possible. This includes:
  * People involved, if known
  * Contact info of the person reporting the violation (this should only be used for you to follow up with the person once a decision has been made)
  * When and where the violation happened
  * What happened
  * If the violation is ongoing
* If no one is in immediate danger, respect the person's right to anonymity, as well as any other witnesses.

## Enforcing the Community Code of Conduct

Consequences for violating the Community Code of Conduct are outlined in the Community Code of Conduct.  RCOS mentors are expected to follow and enforce the Community Code of Conduct whereever possible, and failing to do so will result in appropriate consequences. The following actions are not permitted with regards to the Community Code of Conduct:
* Deliberately and knowingly ignoring legitimate reports of CoC violations
* Deliberately and knowingly failing to enforce the Code of Conduct appropriately
* Coercing members to withdraw reports of misconduct
* Encouraging or inciting members to violate the Code of Conduct
* Falsely accusing members of violating the Code of Conduct
* Making false or fraudulent reports to faculty members or project owners (as outlined below)

As a mentor, you are also limited in your power to enforce the Community Code of Conduct. Before enforcing anything more severe than a simple verbal or Slack warning, you must:
* Consult a faculty member if the person violating the Code of Conduct is enrolled in RCOS at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.
* Consult the project owner if the person violating the Code of Conduct is not affiliated with RPI.  

If anyone's safety is at risk (e.g. threats of violence or present physical danger), you may act immediately to protect safety. 

## Consequences
Consequences of not following the Mentor Code of Conduct are subject to faculty discretion and may include any of the consequences for violating the Community Code of Conduct as well as temporary or permanent loss of mentorship privileges depending on the severity of the offense.
